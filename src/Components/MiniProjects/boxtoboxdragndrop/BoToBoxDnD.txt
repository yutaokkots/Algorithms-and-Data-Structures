Box-to-Box Drag and Drop
Create two large squares on the screen and fill one of them with smaller squares. The design, color, and layout is completely up to you, but make sure that each small square is uniquely identifiable using text, color, etc.

Requirements:

Any small box dragged and dropped over another small box should swap positions with the other small box
Any small box dragged and dropped on the other large square should be moved to that square and swapped with any small box already there
There should be a button that allows the user to reset the small box positions
There should be a button that allows the user to randomize the layout and positioning of the small boxes within both large squares
The final project needs to work in the latest stable versions of Chrome and Safari. Once completed, compress all files into a zip archive and send it back.
