'''
663. Walls and Gates
Medium

Description
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

-1 : A wall or an obstacle.
0 : A gate.
INF : Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a Gate, that room should remain filled with INF

Example1

Input:
[[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]]
Output:
[[3,-1,0,1],[2,2,1,-1],[1,-1,2,-1],[0,-1,3,4]]

Explanation:
the 2D grid is:
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
the answer is:
  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4

Example 2:

Input:
[[0,-1],[2147483647,2147483647]]
Output:
[[0,-1],[1,2]]
