Don't Repeat Yourself

## REACTO

Repeat

Approach
Code

Optimize

## BUD

Bottlenecks
Unnecessary Work
Duplicated Work

## BCR

Best Conceivable Runtime

What is the best runtime we can get, and can our current algorithm head towards that?
If BCR is O(N),
>>> can we go from O(N^2) -> O(NlogN) -> O(N) ?

# Good code -> REMSiCo

Readable
Efficient
Maintainable
Simple
Correct

## BTY

Better Than Yesterday
