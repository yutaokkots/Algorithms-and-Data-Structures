# Intersection
# Given two singly linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the intersecting node
# Note that the intersection is based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is 
# the same exact node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersecting
