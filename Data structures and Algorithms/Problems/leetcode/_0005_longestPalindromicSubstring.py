        res = ""

        for i in range(len(s)):
            for l, r in ((i,i), (i,i+1)): # odd and even lengths
                while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                    if (r - l + 1) > len(res):
                        res = s[l:r + 1]
                    l -= 1
                    r += 1

        return r
